# TourMeApp
The app I have chosen for my final project aims to make traveling easier for tourists in any city around the world.
However, due to the class scope limitations, I have focused on designing it specifically for the city of San Francisco.
In this app, tourists can log in and choose from a list of places they want to visit. For each selected package, 
they can see the description, cost, reviews, and feedback before adding it to their tour list. Once they have added
all the packages they want, they can proceed to check out. They will then receive a confirmation of their tour
in the app, as well as through text if they have provided their number.
